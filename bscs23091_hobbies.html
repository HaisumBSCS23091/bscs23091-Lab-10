                <h1> Piano</h1>
                <p1>
                    My hobbies mainly include <b><i><u>playing the piano and composing music</u></i></b>.
                    Every instrument has it's own personality. However, piano is an 
                    extremely unique instrument. It is classy and elegant. The sound
                    of the piano is very mellow and soft. Whenever I am stressed, my way
                    of relaxing is to play the piano. It makes me feel dreamy.

                <h1> Robotics</h1>
                <p1>
                    Besides music, I am also very passionate about robotics and computer science. I am proficient in 7 
                    programming languages inlcuding but not limited to c++, python, c#, visual basic and more. I often
                    use online platforms like Udemy and Coursera to study beyond the classroom. In this pursuit, I completed
                    more than 30 courses related to STEM. This was done over a period of 3 years and I still continue to study online
                    in my free time.
