<h1>Introduction</h1>
My name is <b><u><i>Haisum Haroon</i></u></b> and I am resident of Lahore, Pakistan. I strongly believe in <b>integrity</b>, <b>kindness</b>, and <b>hard work</b>. 
These three principles are very important
components of my life. Integrity is a very all encompassing word and means showing sincerity and building trust towards others. It is a very
precious virtue and nurtures a different type of freedom to
express yourself, bond with others and make permanent memories. Similarly,
the act of being kind is equally valuable as there is nothing more powerful than
uplifting the people around you and offering a supporting hand in times of difficulty. Lastly, I
think it is the rule of nature that hard work allows you to navigate through the steepest roads and
achieve success from any point in life.
