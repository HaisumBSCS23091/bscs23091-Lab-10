            O/A-Levels
            </h1>
            <p>
            I did my O/A Levels from Lahore Grammar School Johar Town (LGS JT). I spent some of the best moments
            of my life in that institution. Nonetheless, I will admit that my time there was nothing less than a 
        scary roller coaster ride with lots of ups and downs. I learned a lot and my personality grew in a lot of
    different ways. Primarily, the environment there was very stimulating and strongly contributed to my character 
development. </p>

     <h1>University</h1>
     <p>
        I am
        enrolled in the bachelors of computer science program at Information Technology University. So far, my experience here has
        been remarkable and I am extremely thrilled for what is ahead. In the near future, I hope to
        utilize the research opportunities at ITU and collaborate with professors. My long-term goal is to
        pursue a doctorate degree and eventually work in academia. On the other hand, I am a very light-
        hearted person who loves to have some fun. Therefore, I am looking forward to explore sports
        and debates as well.
